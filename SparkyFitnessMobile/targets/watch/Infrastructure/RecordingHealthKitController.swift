/// The workout it saves to Apple Health carries `SparkyFitnessSessionId`, the

/// inbound sync skips it instead of filing the run a second time.

/// recording was saved or discarded. When it finishes, the collection is
/// stopped but the workout is held (`Outcome.hold`); the phone's verdict then
/// finishes it (`resolveHeld(save: true)`) or throws it away. A workout that
/// was already written cannot be reliably taken back out of Health, since
/// deleting the `HKWorkout` does not remove every sample attached to it.
