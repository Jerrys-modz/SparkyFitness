/**
 * Per-run limits on workout telemetry collection.
 *
 * Collecting a route and the per-workout sample series costs on the order of a
 * second per workout. A background task gets only a few tens of seconds before
 * the OS kills it, and being killed mid-read loses the entire sync — so
 * background runs enrich just the newest few workouts and send the rest as
 * summaries. Because the server upserts workouts on (source, source_id), a
 * later interactive sync re-sends the skipped ones with telemetry and upgrades
 * the existing entries in place rather than duplicating them.
 *
 * Limits are carried by a per-run context rather than module state: background
 * tasks, manual syncs, and the iOS observer path are not mutually exclusive,
 * and a shared flag would let a capped background run silently strip the
 * budget (and route-consent UI) from a foreground sync running at the same
 * moment.
 *
 * Lives in `shared/` rather than beside either provider so run shells can
 * build a context without importing a platform-specific module.
