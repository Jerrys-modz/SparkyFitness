-- Loaded carries and holds (issue #127 step 1, upstream #2481).
--
-- Two new modalities. weight_distance: sets carry a weight and a distance
-- (farmer's walk, yoke, sandbag, sled push); the distance is stored in km in
-- exercise_entry_sets.distance like every other set distance. weight_duration:
-- sets carry a weight and a duration in seconds (weighted plank). Neither
-- records reps.
--
-- Only the CHECK constraints change; no existing row is converted. Idempotent:
-- each constraint is dropped if present and recreated with the full list.
-- Validation is a later migration: this runner sends a whole file as one
-- transaction, and validating here would hold the add-constraint lock for the
-- scan.
